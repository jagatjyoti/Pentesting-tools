# Pentesting-tools

Beginner level pentesting tools knitted using python.

## Description

This program mostly does basic level security testing for a website i.e. [reqres](https://reqres.in/). This site provides wonderful REST APIs for testing cool stuff. This script can be used to perform very basic level security testing for your web app as well. 

## Execution

The program needs to be executed using sudo as below: 

```
$ sudo python web_security.py
```

## Sample Output

```
$ sudo python web_security.py

Reference: https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7230#section-3.3.1
Security Description: Response splitting (a.k.a, CRLF injection) is a common technique, used in various attacks on Web usage, that exploits the line-based nature of HTTP message framing and the ordered association of requests to responses on persistent connections. This technique can be particularly damaging when the requests pass through a shared cache.
Security Reference: https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7230#section-9
Recommendations: A common defense against response splitting is to filter requests for data that looks like encoded CR and LF (e.g., "%0D" and "%0A"). However, that assumes the application server is only performing URI decoding, rather than more obscure data transformations like charset transcoding, XML entity translation, base64 decoding, sprintf reformatting, etc. A more effective mitigation is to prevent anything other than the server's core protocol libraries from sending a CR or LF within the header section, which means restricting the output of header fields to APIs that filter for bad octets and not allowing application servers to write directly to the protocol stream.

In particular, cookies encourage developers to rely on ambient authority for authentication, often becoming vulnerable to attacks such as cross-site request forgery. Also, when storing session identifiers in cookies, developers often create session fixation vulnerabilities. Transport-layer encryption, such as that employed in HTTPS, is insufficient to prevent a network attacker from obtaining or altering a victim's cookies because the cookie protocol itself has various vulnerabilities. In addition, by default, cookies do not provide confidentiality or integrity from network attackers, even when used in conjunction with HTTPS.
Security Reference: https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6265#section-8
Recommendations: Please at least read these references: https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6265#section-8 and https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Session_Management_Cheat_Sheet#Cookies.
CWE: CWE-614: Sensitive Cookie in HTTPS Session Without 'Secure' Attribute
CWE URL: https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/614.html

Header Field Name: Server 
Value: cloudflare-nginx
Reference: https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231#section-7.4.2
Security Description: Overly long and detailed Server field values increase response latency and potentially reveal internal implementation details that might make it (slightly) easier for attackers to find and exploit known security holes.
Security Reference: https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231#section-7.4.2
Recommendations: An origin server SHOULD NOT generate a Server field containing needlessly fine-grained detail and SHOULD limit the addition of subproducts by third parties.
CWE: CWE-200: Information Exposure
CWE URL: https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/200.html

Header Field Name: Access-Control-Allow-Origin 
Value: *
Reference: http://www.w3.org/TR/cors/#access-control-allow-origin-response-header
Security Description: The Access-Control-Allow-Origin header indicates whether a resource can be shared based by returning the value of the Origin request header, "*", or "null" in the response.
Security Reference: http://www.w3.org/TR/cors/#security
Recommendations: A GET response whose entity body happens to parse as ECMAScript can return an Access-Control-Allow-Origin header whose value is "*" provided there are no sensitive comments as it can be accessed cross-origin using an HTML script element. If needed, such resources can implement access control and CSRF protections as described above.
CWE: CWE-352: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
CWE URL: https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/352.html

Header Field Name: Content-Type 
Value: text/html; charset=utf-8
Reference: https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231#section-3.1.1.5
Security Description: In practice, resource owners do not always properly configure their origin server to provide the correct Content-Type for a given representation, with the result that some clients will examine a payload's content and override the specified type. Clients that do so risk drawing incorrect conclusions, which might expose additional security risks (e.g., "privilege escalation").
Security Reference: https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231#section-3.1.1.5
Recommendations: Properly configure their origin server to provide the correct Content-Type for a given representation.
CWE: CWE-430: Deployment of Wrong Handler
CWE URL: https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/430.html

>> RESPONSE MISSING HEADERS <<
Header Field Name: Pragma
Reference: https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7234#section-5.4
Security Description: Caches expose additional potential vulnerabilities, since the contents of the cache represent an attractive target for malicious exploitation.
Security Reference: https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7234#section-8
Recommendations: The "Pragma" header field allows backwards compatibility with HTTP/1.0 caches, so that clients can specify a "no-cache" request that they will understand (as Cache-Control was not defined until HTTP/1.1). When the Cache-Control header field is also present and understood in a request, Pragma is ignored. Define "Pragma: no-cache" whenever is possible.
CWE: CWE-524: Information Exposure Through Caching
CWE URL: https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/524.html
HTTPS: N

Header Field Name: Public-Key-Pins
Reference: https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7469
Security Description: HTTP Public Key Pinning (HPKP) is a trust on first use security mechanism which protects HTTPS websites from impersonation using fraudulent certificates issued by compromised certificate authorities. The security context or pinset data is supplied by the site or origin.
Security Reference: https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7469
Recommendations: Deploying Public Key Pinning (PKP) safely will require operational and organizational maturity due to the risk that hosts may make themselves unavailable by pinning to a set of SPKIs that becomes invalid. With care, host operators can greatly reduce the risk of man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks and other false- authentication problems for their users without incurring undue risk. PKP is meant to be used together with HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) [RFC6797], but it is possible to pin keys without requiring HSTS.
CWE: CWE-295: Improper Certificate Validation
CWE URL: https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/295.html
HTTPS: Y

Header Field Name: Public-Key-Pins-Report-Only

HTTPS: Y

Header Field Name: Strict-Transport-Security
Reference: https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6797
Security Description: HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) is a web security policy mechanism which helps to protect secure HTTPS websites against downgrade attacks and cookie hijacking. It allows web servers to declare that web browsers (or other complying user agents) should only interact with it using secure HTTPS connections, and never via the insecure HTTP protocol. HSTS is an IETF standards track protocol and is specified in RFC 6797.
Security Reference: https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6797
Recommendations: Please at least read this reference: https://www.owasp.org/index.php/HTTP_Strict_Transport_Security.
CWE: CWE-311: Missing Encryption of Sensitive Data
CWE URL: https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/311.html
HTTPS: Y

Header Field Name: X-Frame-Options
Reference: https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7034
Security Description: The use of "X-Frame-Options" allows a web page from host B to declare that its content (for example, a button, links, text, etc.) must not be displayed in a frame (<frame> or <iframe>) of another page (e.g., from host A). This is done by a policy declared in the HTTP header and enforced by browser implementations.
Security Reference: https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7034
Recommendations:  In 2009 and 2010, many browser vendors ([Microsoft-X-Frame-Options] and [Mozilla-X-Frame-Options]) introduced the use of a non-standard HTTP [RFC2616] header field "X-Frame-Options" to protect against clickjacking. Please check here https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Clickjacking_Defense_Cheat_Sheet what's the best option for your case.
CWE: CWE-693: Protection Mechanism Failure
CWE URL: https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/693.html
HTTPS: N

Header Field Name: X-XSS-Protection
Reference: http://blogs.msdn.com/b/ie/archive/2008/07/02/ie8-security-part-iv-the-xss-filter.aspx
Security Description: This header enables the Cross-site scripting (XSS) filter built into most recent web browsers. It's usually enabled by default anyway, so the role of this header is to re-enable the filter for this particular website if it was disabled by the user. This header is supported in IE 8+, and in Chrome (not sure which versions). The anti-XSS filter was added in Chrome 4. Its unknown if that version honored this header.
Security Reference: https://www.owasp.org/index.php/List_of_useful_HTTP_headers
Recommendations: Use "X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block" whenever is possible (ref. http://blogs.msdn.com/b/ieinternals/archive/2011/01/31/controlling-the-internet-explorer-xss-filter-with-the-x-xss-protection-http-header.aspx).
CWE: CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')
CWE URL: https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/79.html
HTTPS: N

Header Field Name: X-Content-Type-Options
Reference: http://blogs.msdn.com/b/ie/archive/2008/09/02/ie8-security-part-vi-beta-2-update.aspx
Security Description: The only defined value, "nosniff", prevents Internet Explorer and Google Chrome from MIME-sniffing a response away from the declared content-type. This also applies to Google Chrome, when downloading extensions. This reduces exposure to drive-by download attacks and sites serving user uploaded content that, by clever naming, could be treated by MSIE as executable or dynamic HTML files.
Security Reference: https://www.owasp.org/index.php/List_of_useful_HTTP_headers
Recommendations: Always use the only defined value, "nosniff".

Header Field Name: Content-Security-Policy
Reference: http://www.w3.org/TR/CSP/
Security Description: Content Security Policy requires careful tuning and precise definition of the policy. If enabled, CSP has significant impact on the way browser renders pages (e.g., inline JavaScript disabled by default and must be explicitly allowed in policy). CSP prevents a wide range of attacks, including Cross-site scripting and other cross-site injections.
